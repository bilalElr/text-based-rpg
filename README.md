this needs a lot of optimization (and probably some more debugging). i dont know if this will ever become something bigger than what it is now, but who knows. if you played this then you know me because i sent it to you. feel free to critique the code, gameplay, whatever you want in our DMs. if you have any ideas you would like me to implement, please let me know.
have fun!
